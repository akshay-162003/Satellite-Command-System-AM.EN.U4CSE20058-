# Satellite-Command-System-AM.EN.U4CSE20058-
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The series of commands should be executed in a sequential manner over the initial state, altering the satellite's state accordingly. You could execute them through function calls, or simulate a command-line interface where these commands can be entered.

POSSIBLE COMMANDS:
rotate(South)
activatePanels()
collectData()

EXPLANATION:
This Python program is a simulated Satellite Command System, complete with a `Satellite` class that allows for rotation, activation and deactivation of solar panels, and data collection. Users are able to interact with the system through a main execution loop, where they can input commands to control the satellite's actions. The code is designed to handle multiline commands and execute them seamlessly, providing immediate updates on the satellite's orientation, solar panel status, and collected data. Advanced error handling and detailed logging enhance the reliability and information provided to the user, resulting in a highly effective and user-friendly system.
